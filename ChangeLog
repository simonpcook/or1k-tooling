	Update to make use of upstream repositories where possible.
	* or1k-clone-all.sh: Split cloning of binutils and gdb in order to
	pull from different upstream repositories.  Simplify the
	clone_tool function in order to make handling different remotes
	easier.
	* or1k-test-all.sh: Take account of different binutils and gdb
	directories.  Allow gas/ld/binutils/gdb to each have a different
	path, currently only gdb does.
	* or1k-build-all.sh: Updated based on new upstream instructions.
	Includes build of newlib, build binutils without gdb from
	upstream, and then build gdb separately from or1k repository.
